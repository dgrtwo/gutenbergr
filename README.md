Download and process public domain works from the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) collection. Includes

* A function `gutenberg_download()` that downloads one or more works from Project Gutenberg by ID: e.g., `gutenberg_download(84)` downloads the text of Frankenstein.
* Metadata for all Project Gutenberg works as R datasets, so that they can be searched and filtered:
  * `gutenberg_metadata` contains information about each work, pairing Gutenberg ID with title, author, language, etc
  * `gutenberg_authors` contains information about each author, such as aliases and birth/death year
  * `gutenberg_subjects` contains pairings of works with Library of Congress subjects and topics

### Installation

Install the package with:


```r
install.packages("gutenbergr")
```

Or install the development version using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) with:


```r
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/gutenbergr")
```

### Examples

The `gutenberg_works()` function retrieves, by default, a table of metadata for all unique English-language Project Gutenberg works that have text associated with them. (The `gutenberg_metadata` dataset has all Gutenberg works, unfiltered).



Suppose we wanted to download Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights." We could find the book's ID by filtering:


```r

library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(gutenbergr)

gutenberg_works() %>% 
  filter(title == "Wuthering Heights")

gutenberg_works() %>%
  filter(title == "Wuthering Heights")
#> # A tibble: 1 × 8
#>   gutenberg_id             title        author gutenberg_author_id language
#>          <int>             <chr>         <chr>               <int>    <chr>
#> 1          768 Wuthering Heights Brontë, Emily                 405       en
#>                                   gutenberg_bookshelf
#>                                                 <chr>
#> 1 Gothic Fiction/Movie Books/Best Books Ever Listings
#> # ... with 2 more variables: rights <chr>, has_text <lgl>

# or just:
gutenberg_works(title == "Wuthering Heights")
#> # A tibble: 1 × 8
#>   gutenberg_id             title        author gutenberg_author_id language
#>          <int>             <chr>         <chr>               <int>    <chr>
#> 1          768 Wuthering Heights Brontë, Emily                 405       en
#>                                   gutenberg_bookshelf
#>                                                 <chr>
#> 1 Gothic Fiction/Movie Books/Best Books Ever Listings
#> # ... with 2 more variables: rights <chr>, has_text <lgl>
```

Since we see that it has `gutenberg_id` 768, we can download it with the `gutenberg_download()` function:


```r
wuthering_heights <- gutenberg_download(768)
wuthering_heights
#> # A tibble: 12,085 × 2
#>    gutenberg_id                                                                    text
#>           <int>                                                                   <chr>
#> 1           768                                                       WUTHERING HEIGHTS
#> 2           768

`gutenberg_download` can download multiple books when given multiple IDs. It also takes a `meta_fields` argument that will add variables from the metadata.


```r
# 1260 is the ID of Jane Eyre
books <- gutenberg_download(c(768, 1260), meta_fields = "title")
books
#> # A tibble: 32,744 × 3
#>    gutenberg_id                                                                    text

#> 1           768                                                       WUTHERING HEIGHTS

#> 5           768

books %>%
  count(title)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 2
#>                         title     n

#> 2           Wuthering Heights 12085
```

It can also take the output of `gutenberg_works` directly. For example, we could get the text of all Aristotle's works, each annotated with both `gutenberg_id` and `title`, using:


```r
aristotle_books <- gutenberg_works(author == "Aristotle") %>%
  gutenberg_download(meta_fields = "title")

aristotle_books
#> # A tibble: 39,950 × 3
#>    gutenberg_id                                                                   text
#>           <int>                                                                  <chr>

### FAQ

#### What do I do with the text once I have it?

* The [Natural Language Processing CRAN View](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=NaturalLanguageProcessing) suggests many R packages related to text mining, especially around the [tm package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tm).
* The [tidytext](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) package is useful for tokenization and analysis, especially since gutenbergr downloads books as a data frame already.
* You could match the `wikipedia` column in `gutenberg_author` to Wikipedia content with the [WikipediR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=WikipediR) package or to pageview statistics with the [wikipediatrend](https://cran.r-project.org/package=wikipediatrend) package.
* If you're considering an analysis based on author name, you may find the [humaniformat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=humaniformat) (for extraction of first names) and [gender](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gender) (prediction of gender from first names) packages useful. (Note that humaniformat has a `format_reverse` function for reversing "Last, First" names).

#### How were the metadata R files generated?

See the [data-raw](data-raw) directory for the scripts that generate these datasets. As of now, these were generated from [the Project Gutenberg catalog](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Feeds#The_Complete_Project_Gutenberg_Catalog) on **05 May 2016**.

#### Do you respect the rules regarding robot access to Project Gutenberg?

Yes! The package respects [these rules](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Information_About_Robot_Access_to_our_Pages) and complies to the best of our ability. Namely:

* Project Gutenberg allows wget to harvest Project Gutenberg using [this list of links](http://www.gutenberg.org/robot/harvest?filetypes[]=html). The gutenbergr package visits that page once to find the recommended mirror for the user's location.
* We retrieve the book text directly from that mirror using links in the same format. For example, Frankenstein (book 84) is retrieved from `http://www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/8/84/84.zip`.
* We retrieve the .zip file rather than txt to minimize bandwidth on the mirror.

Still, this package is *not* the right way to download the entire Project Gutenberg corpus (or all from a particular language). For that, follow [their recommendation](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Information_About_Robot_Access_to_our_Pages) to use wget or set up a mirror. This package is recommended for downloading a single work, or works for a particular author or topic.
